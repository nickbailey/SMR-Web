<em>Scottish Music Review</em> (<em>SMR</em>) is a peer-reviewed online journal created
and managed by the Universities of Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow,
and the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland.
</p>
<p> 
The journal publishes music research in all its diversity,
including composition and practice-led research.
The on-line platform allows contributors the flexibility to include audio,
video and other material suited to an online environment in their submissions.
Compositions and other creative or performative artefacts
should normally be accompanied by a commentary.
</p>
<p>
<em>Scottish Music Review</em> aims to publish one issue per year.
</p>
<p>
<em>Scottish Music Review</em> provides immediate open access to its content
on the principle that making research freely available to the public
supports a greater global exchange of knowledge.
</p>
<p>
<em>Scottish Music Review</em> is available via RILM Abstracts of Music
with Full Text as well as through its own online platform.
