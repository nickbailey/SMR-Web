<p>
Submissions are welcome from academics working within a Higher Education environment,
independent scholars, composers and musicians.
Although the online environment provides scope for work of varying length,
text-based work will normally be between 5,000 and 10,000 words in length.
</p>
<p>
Usually, a submission will be peer-reviewed by one member of the Board
and other one reader with specialist knowledge of the field.
</p>
<p>
<em>Scottish Music Review</em> accepts submission of material for consideration 
that is
<ul>
<li>original work which has not been previously published;</li>
<li>?that is not being considered elsewhere for publication;</li>
<li>that, if accepted for publication,
will not be published elsewhere in the same form, in any language,
without the consent of the editors and publishers.</li>
</ul>
It is a condition of the acceptance by the editors of a submission for publication
that the publisher acquires automatically exclusive rights to first publication
throughout the world. Copyright will remain with the author(s).
</p>
<p>
Material for consideration should be sent to the Editor, Professor David J. Smith, by email
(<a href="mailto:d.j.smith@abdn-ac-uk">d.j.smith@abdn-ac-uk</a> &mdash; change - to .),
or using Dropbox if the submission includes large files. The postal address is:

<h3>Permissions</h3>
<p>
Please ensure that you follow academic conventions in acknowledging the work of others,
and that you have obtained all necessary permissions for copyright material used.
</p>
<p>
The journal is free to access, and is not a commercial operation.
</p>

<h3>Submission: Option 1</h3>

<p>
Text may be submitted in Microsoft Word format <b>without using styles</b>,
or in RTF or WordPerfect format. References should be inserted as endnotes;
any recognisable citation style, if used consistently,
is acceptable provided that it includes full information about each item.
</p>
<p>
Music examples, illustrations, figures, tables, and audio/video
should be sent as separate files; indicate clearly
where they should be inserted into the article.
</p>
<p>
Music examples should be submitted as high-resolution PDF files
with embedded fonts or high-resolution 1200dpi TIF files,
and should be accompanied by the original music files.
</p>
<p>
Graphics, audio and video should be provided in any standard file format.
</p>

<h3>Submission: Option 2</h3>

<p>Articles are typeset in XeLaTeX
so alternatively authors may opt to typeset their own work.
</p>
<p>
Everything you need can be had from the
<a class="offsite" target="SMRgit" href="https://github.com/nickbailey/SMR">SMR&nbsp;GitHub</a>
page using the command</p>
<code>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;git clone https://github.com/nickbailey/SMR</code>
<p>If you only use the LaTeX suite infrequently, or do not have
neither the necessary software to clone the git, you may
<a href="Resources/empty.zip">download</a> a zipped archive which,
unpacked, creates a folder with an empty SMR paper. The folder
will be called "SMR_Submission". The empty paper looks like
<a class="pdflink" href="Resources/empty.pdf" target="SMR">this</a>, and it is
created by XeLaTeX from the file
<a href="https://github.com/nickbailey/SMR/blob/master/empty.tex"><tt>empty.tex</tt></a>.
Use your preferred LaTeX editor to create your document.
</p>

<p>We have also produced a guidance document for authors in the
form of an extended "cheat sheet" &mdash; this is <em>not</em>
an introduction to XeLaTeX (although some documents useful in that regard
are referenced). You can view or download it from
<a class="pdflink" href="Resources/SMR_Article.pdf" target="SMR">here</a>.</p>
