## Synopsis

This is a proposed framework for the Scottish
Music Review (SMR)  website.
The SMR is an open-access, refereed academic Journal.

## Cloning

This project has submodules. Clone it with
``git clone --recursive https://github.com/nickbailey/SMR-Web``

## Motivation

We provide a front page which immediately allows users to
search and browse a small journal's content either by issue,
by author or by title. As it is intended to cope with smaller
journals, the entire bibliography is downloaded when
the home page is contacted. Searching and displaying the
relevant article entries is performed locally in JavaScript,
so no further exchange with the server is required until
an article is read.
